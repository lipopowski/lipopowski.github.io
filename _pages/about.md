## About Me
I am a fifth year PhD candidate in computer science in the [HCI Group](https://hci.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, advised by [Michael Bernstein](https://hci.stanford.edu/msb/). Previously, I attended Harvey Mudd College, where I earned a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics and concentrated in literature. I am currently supported by the [Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/programs-and-events/phd-fellowship/recipients/) and the [Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sigf).

My research areas fall broadly within human-computer interaction (HCI) and social computing. I combine empirical work and system design/building to critique and reimagine the online spaces that mediate our social interactions. 

In general, I care about understanding how to create online spaces with better social and psychological outcomes. Currently, I'm thinking about: rethinking the current paradigm of social media feeds, folk theories/mental models/what it means to understand an algorithmic system, and how to design social media platforms that support and encourage relationship formation.


## Past Work
Before starting my PhD, I worked on projects related to HCI+AI, planning and scheduling, and interdisciplinary CS. Most of this work was done via the CS summer research program at Harvey Mudd College or the REUSE program at CMU's ISR.

## Personal
My life is more than research! I'm a fan of a lot of things, and am probably a little too immersed in the online world. I love to bake  cook, read, write, and make art. I read a lot of fiction and review books on the side.
