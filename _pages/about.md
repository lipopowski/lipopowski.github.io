## Currently
I am visiting the [Hasso Plattner Institut](https://hpi.de/en/research/research-school/international-branches/hasso-plattner-institute.html%E2%80%8B) in Potsdam, Germany for the summer. I am working with [Ralf Herbrich](https://hpi.de/herbrich/people/ralf-herbrich.html) in the [AI and Sustainability cluster](https://hpi.de/en/research/research-groups/artificial-intelligence-and-sustainability.html) during my visit.

## About me
I am a third year PhD student in computer science in the [HCI Group](https://hci.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, advised by [Michael Bernstein](https://hci.stanford.edu/msb/). Previously, I attended Harvey Mudd College, where I earned a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics and concentrated in literature.

My research areas fall broadly within human-computer interaction (HCI) and social computing. I combine empirical work and system design/building to critique and reimagine the online spaces that mediate our social interactions. 

In general, I care about understanding how to create online spaces with better social and psychological outcomes. Currently, I'm thinking about: participatory online communities, folk theories/mental models/what it means to understand an algorithmic system, and how to design social media and user-generated content platforms with relationships as a priority rather than content consumption.


## Past Work
Before starting my PhD, I worked on projects related to HCI+AI, planning and scheduling, and interdisciplinary CS. Most of this work was done via the CS summer research program at Harvey Mudd College or the REUSE program at CMU's ISR.

## Collaborators and Mentors

I have been privileged to work with the following researchers in various capacities (summer research, REUs, rotation projects, in addition to official advising)
- [Michael Bernstein](https://hci.stanford.edu/msb/), PhD advisor
- [Jeff Hancock](https://comm.stanford.edu/people/jeffrey-hancock), collaborator & spring rotation with [Stanford SML](https://sml.stanford.edu/)
- [Ang√®le Christin](http://www.angelechristin.com/), winter rotation
- [Toby Jia-Jun Li](https://toby.li/), summer REU mentor
- [Jim Boerkoel](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~boerkoel/), summer research advisor in the [HEATlab](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/HEAT/)
- [Zachary Dodds](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~dodds/), summer research advisor

## Personal
My life is more than research! I'm a fan of a lot of things and am probably a little too immersed in popular and fan culture. I love to bake (and sometimes share the product with my lab), cook, read, write, and make art. I review books on the side too! Outside of computer science, I'm also interested in physics, math, media studies, and social history. I care deeply about education justice and equity, inside and outside of computer science, and inside and outside of the academy.
