## About
I am a first year PhD student in computer science in the [HCI Group](https://hci.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, advised by [Michael Bernstein](https://hci.stanford.edu/msb/). Previously, I attended Harvey Mudd College, where I earned a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics.

My research areas fall broadly within human-computer interaction (HCI) and social computing. I am interested in digital self-representation, online communities, and pro-social social media design. My research strives to understand the behavior and experience of people on social media, as well as design new social computing systems to improve said experience. I'm especially passionate about the experiences of queer and neurodivergent people online.

In general, I care about understanding how to create online spaces with better social and psychological outcomes. Currently, I'm thinking about (spoiler alert): tiktok affordances, influencers and authenticity, and low-stakes participation in online communities.


## Past Work
Before starting my PhD, I did research in HCI+AI, planning and scheduling, and interdisciplinary CS. Most of this work was done via the CS summer research program at Harvey Mudd or an REU.

## Collaborators and Mentors

I have been privileged to work with the following researchers in various capacities (summer research, REUs, rotation projects, in addition to official advising)
- [Michael Bernstein](https://hci.stanford.edu/msb/), PhD advisor
- [Jeff Hancock](https://comm.stanford.edu/faculty-hancock/), spring rotation with [Stanford SML](https://sml.stanford.edu/)
- [Ang√®le Christin](http://www.angelechristin.com/), winter rotation
- [Toby Jia-Jun Li](https://toby.li/), summer REU mentor
- [Jim Boerkoel](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~boerkoel/), summer research advisor in the [HEATlab](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/HEAT/)
- [Zachary Dodds](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~dodds/), summer research advisor

## Personal
In addition to doing research, I also live a life. (However, I grew up online, so my life and research have a very close relationship.) I love to bake (and sometimes share the product with my lab), cook, read, and make art. I care deeply about education justice and equity, and not just in computer science.
